        intro: "Final-year Physics student at IPB University with a strong technical foundation in AI, Intelligent IoT, and Embedded Systems. I specialize in bridging the gap between theoretical physics and practical engineering to build data-driven hardware solutions.",
        story1: 'Throughout my journey, I have engineered high-accuracy systems, including an autonomous grass-cutting robot and a smart health monitoring band (85-90% accuracy) utilizing ESP32, TensorFlow, and PyTorch. My passion for innovation extends to my research, where I apply Neural Networks to classify stellar evolutionary phases and synthesize Carbon Quantum Dots for cancer theranostics systems.',
        story2: "Beyond technical skills, I am an experienced leader who served as Vice President of HIMAFI, coordinating 60+ staff members and managing cross-departmental programs. As a Laboratory Assistant for Sensor and Analog Electronics, I have mentored over 130 students, focusing on troubleshooting and signal analysis.",
        story3: "When I'm not coding or studying, you'll find me writing about tech trends, reviewing the latest AI tools, or exploring new frameworks and libraries.",
